# CrunchyRoll Clone Page

This is a project/repository that is solely for educational purposes. It's intended to allow me to practice my skills using the RemixRun framework, ReactJS, CSS, and LocalStorage. The page includes the following:

- **Home Page**
- **Login & Register**
- **Account**
- **WatchList**

> It's worth mentioning and emphasizing that this project only has minimal functionality since it is purely Front-End.
